Hi, I'm Rajat 👋

I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer with over two years of experience crafting user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web applications. Originally from the dynamic tech scene of India 🇮🇳, my journey has taken me across continents to Canada 🇨🇦, where I’ve embraced new opportunities, challenges, and cultures. Let me take you through my story of passion, perseverance, and progress.

## Growing Up: Where It All Began

My fascination with technology started young. The idea that lines of code could transform into solutions captivated me. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor’s in Information Technology from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, where I built a solid foundation in software development and honed my problem-solving skills.

## Starting Out: My Early Career at Coforge

My professional journey kicked off at Coforge, where I worked as a Software Engineer. One of my proudest accomplishments there was developing intuitive web interfaces for the Lifewriter project, a platform for a leading US insurance firm. By leveraging **React.js**, **TypeScript**, **Spring Boot**, and **PostgreSQL**, I optimized performance and reduced page load times by 20%, improving user engagement by 35%.

Beyond coding, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration by participating in Agile ceremonies, working alongside UI/UX designers, and ensuring every product met high accessibility and branding standards.

## A Bold Move: Relocating to Canada

In 2023, I made the leap to Canada to pursue a Post Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Solutions at Humber Polytechnic. This decision was driven by my hunger to explore cutting-edge technologies and grow as a global tech professional. The journey was challenging but equally rewarding.

## Pushing Boundaries: My Recent Experiences

### Full Stack Development at Credwise

Currently, I’m interning as a Full Stack Developer at Credwise, where I’m building **ImmigrateX**, a MERN-stack web application designed to help immigrants in Canada. The platform simplifies pre- and post-arrival tasks like securing housing, applying for essential documents, and connecting with local resources. My role involves designing intuitive workflows for clients like realtors and dealerships and crafting onboarding features to make their processes seamless.

### Researching at Humber Polytechnic

At Humber, I’ve been contributing as a Research Associate. My focus is curating a specialized library of resources for advanced topics like **Java**, **C#**, and **data structures**. These resources aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, empowering students and educators alike.

## Side Projects: Where Creativity Shines

### FormFlow

One of my favorite creations, **FormFlow**, is a Next.js application that lets users design forms with drag-and-drop functionality. By integrating real-time sharing and submission tracking, it’s a testament to my love for building user-centric tools.

### RetailEase

Another highlight is **RetailEase**, a full-stack retail management system I built using **React.js** and **Spring Boot**. By automating inventory updates and streamlining checkout processes, this project reduced manual errors by 50% and boosted efficiency.

## Hackathons: Where Innovation Meets Collaboration

Hackathons have been some of the most exciting and transformative experiences in my journey. They’ve shown me how creativity, teamwork, and adrenaline can spark incredible innovation.

### Matera Fintech Ideathon

In November 2024, I participated in the **Matera Fintech Ideathon**, where my team developed an AI-powered fraud detection solution. The project focused on detecting fake QR codes, assessing risk scores, and notifying merchants of potential threats. After two days of intense brainstorming and coding, we secured a spot among the top 6 finalists. It was a proud moment and a testament to the power of collaboration.

### AWS DeepRacer 2024 Competition

The **AWS DeepRacer Competition** at Humber College was another unforgettable event. Leading a team of four, I designed and implemented a deep learning model for autonomous racing. Optimizing reinforcement learning algorithms to navigate the track effectively, we clinched 3rd place. The thrill of seeing our car race successfully was unmatched.

### Bell Geekfest Hackathon

In September 2023, I joined the **Bell Geekfest Hackathon**, where our team tackled online privacy and security by creating an application to detect malicious URLs. The experience pushed me to think critically about cybersecurity challenges and innovate practical solutions. Presenting our work to industry leaders and receiving valuable mentorship was incredibly rewarding.

## Looking Ahead: A Vision for Innovation

This blog is more than a platform to share my journey; it’s a way to connect, learn, and collaborate with the global tech community. I’m passionate about solving complex challenges, driving innovation, and contributing to meaningful projects.
