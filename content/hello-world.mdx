# Hello World: My Journey in Tech

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Rajat Sachdeva, a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with over two years of experience building responsive, user-friendly web applications and innovating digital experiences. This blog marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life—a platform to share my journey, professional insights, and technical expertise with the global tech community.

## From India to Canada: A Global Perspective

My journey began in the bustling tech ecosystem of India, where I earned a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at Coforge, where I contributed to transformative projects for the insurance sector, streamlining operations and enhancing user engagement.

In 2023, I made a bold decision to move to Canada to pursue a Post Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Solutions at Humber Polytechnic. This move was driven by my desire to embrace new challenges, explore innovative technologies, and grow as a global tech professional.

## The Hustle: Experiences That Shaped Me

### Freelance Adventures

As a Freelance Software Developer, I’ve worked on diverse and impactful projects, including:

- Immigration Agency Web Platform: Built a comprehensive platform using React.js, Spring Boot, and SQL, featuring application tracking, document management, and inquiry forms. This project boosted client engagement and efficiency by 40%.
- Portfolio Website: Designed and developed a sleek portfolio website with React.js, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, helping a creative professional enhance their online presence and client outreach.

### Research and Mentorship

At Humber Polytechnic, I’m contributing as a Research Associate by building a specialized resource library that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical applications. I’ve curated resources for Advanced Java, C#, and data structures, empowering students and educators alike.

### Industry Impact

During my time at Coforge, I:

- Developed responsive web interfaces for the Lifewriter project, improving user engagement for Lincoln Finance by 35%.
- Built an employee-facing application from scratch to manage customer data, policies, claims, and renewals, significantly enhancing operational efficiency.
- Optimized application performance using React.js, TypeScript, Java, and Spring Boot, reducing page load times by 25%.
- Streamlined CI/CD pipelines, reducing production deployment times by 40% and ensuring a 100% on-time release rate.

## Aspirations for the Future
