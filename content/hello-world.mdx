# Hello World: My Journey in Tech

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Rajat Sachdeva, a passionate and results-driven Email Developer with over three years of experience in crafting dynamic email solutions and optimizing marketing campaigns. This blog marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life—a space to share my journey, experiences, and insights with a broader audience.

## From India to Canada: A Global Perspective

I began my journey in the vibrant tech ecosystem of India, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. Over the years, I honed my skills in software development and email marketing, eventually working as a Software Engineer at Coforge. There, I developed dynamic email templates and contributed to the development of insurance applications that streamlined operations and improved data accuracy.

In 2023, I took a leap of faith and moved to Canada to pursue a Post Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Solutions at Humber Polytechnic. This decision was fueled by my desire to expand my horizons, embrace new challenges, and grow as a global tech professional.

## The Hustle: Experiences That Shaped Me

### Freelance Adventures

Currently, I work as a Freelance Software Developer, where I’ve tackled diverse projects, including:

- Building a web platform for an immigration agency using **React.js**, **Spring Boot**, and **SQL**. This platform improved client engagement by 40%.
- Designing and developing a portfolio website with **React.js** and **TailwindCSS** for a creative professional, enhancing their online presence.

### Research and Mentorship

As a Research Associate at Humber Polytechnic, I’m creating a comprehensive resource library to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This includes a specialized library on **Advanced Java**, **C#**, and **data structures**—resources that empower both students and educators.

### Industry Impact

During my tenure at Coforge, I:

- Collaborated with UI/UX designers to ensure email templates adhered to brand guidelines and accessibility standards.
- Streamlined application performance with **Angular**, **MaterialUI**, and **TypeScript**, reducing load times by 25%.
- Optimized deployment pipelines, achieving a 40% reduction in production deployment times.

## Aspirations for the Future

This blog is my way of connecting with the tech community, sharing insights, and giving back. Whether it’s tutorials, project showcases, or reflections on the industry, I hope this space becomes a resource for aspiring developers and tech enthusiasts alike.

I’m excited to share more stories, code snippets, and experiences in the coming months. Let’s embark on this journey together. Stay tuned!
