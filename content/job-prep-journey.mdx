When I moved to Canada, I knew starting a career here wouldn’t be easy — but I also knew persistence and continuous learning would eventually pay off. This is my journey of how I went from **500+ job applications** to landing offers and starting my professional career. 🚀

Job searching in a new country can feel overwhelming — new culture, new processes, and new expectations. I quickly realized that success here meant not just relying on my past experience, but also being willing to **reinvent myself and my approach**.

## 📚 Starting with Learning

My journey began with the [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) on Coursera.  
But I didn’t stop there.

The certificate gave me a strong foundation in front-end development, but the real value came when I started applying those skills in **personal projects**. Every project helped me translate theory into practical experience. At the same time, I began exploring **industry-relevant tools** such as version control, deployment pipelines, and cloud basics, which employers value a lot.

I kept **upskilling** myself by:

- Learning **Git**, **Docker**, and the **basics of Cloud and AI**
- Staying active on **LinkedIn** and connecting with professionals
- Regularly **updating my resume** and tailoring it to roles

## 🎯 The Job Hunt

I started applying during my final semester. At first, it felt like a numbers game — but after months of sending out **500+ applications**, I realized something important:

> Getting a job isn’t just about applying everywhere.  
> It’s about **learning, adapting, and improving** with every rejection.

Every rejection was feedback. Sometimes it was explicit (like missing knowledge in a certain area), and other times it was implicit (such as resume not making it through ATS). I started treating each rejection not as a failure, but as a **data point to improve my strategy**.

I was fortunate to receive interview opportunities with amazing companies like **SOTI**, **Tripadvisor**, and a few others.

These interviews taught me not just technical concepts, but also the importance of **storytelling** — how to communicate my journey, explain my projects, and show growth mindset.

Finally, after countless rejections and learnings, I received **two offers** — from **FDM Group** and **Ellwood Technology**. I chose to join **Ellwood Technology** as an **Information Technology (IT) Consultant**. 🎉

## 🛠️ Following a Structured Plan

![Plan](/job-prep-journey/plan.png)

I followed a structured plan that helped me stay consistent and motivated. You can **download my plan here**:  
👉 [Job Prep Plan PDF](https://topmate.io/rajatsachdeva31/1717311)

Along the way, I:

- Practiced **DSA** and understood common patterns
- Revised the **basics of JavaScript, databases, and OOPs**
- Built several **personal projects** from scratch — which gave me real, hands-on practice

Another key aspect was **consistency**. Instead of randomly applying, I dedicated specific hours each day to applications, preparation, and networking. That structure kept me accountable and reduced burnout.

## 💡 Job Prep Tips That Helped Me

Here are a few actionable strategies that made a difference in my journey and might help you too:

- **Tailor your resume**: Don’t send the same resume everywhere. Highlight the skills and projects most relevant to the job description.
- **Focus on fundamentals**: Strong basics in JavaScript, OOP, and databases often matter more than niche frameworks.
- **Practice mock interviews**: Simulating interview conditions helped me build confidence and improve my communication.
- **Leverage LinkedIn**: Posting about my learning journey and connecting with recruiters/peers opened doors I didn’t expect.
- **Track your applications**: Maintain a simple sheet to log applied jobs, interview stages, and feedback. It keeps you organized and motivated.
- **Keep building projects**: Even small projects show initiative and problem-solving — they also make great talking points in interviews.
